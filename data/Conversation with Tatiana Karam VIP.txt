before 4 hours of the test, there will be an additional charge of AED 150.

Hello Ms Tatiana , how may i help you ?

Tatiana Karam VIP  11-Mar-23, 14:05
Can u please send me the lab results as soon as they are out (and I know I have
to wait a few days longer for the results to display on the app which is fine)?

Bot  11-Mar-23, 14:06
we will surely do our best - they are as well posted on at app the moment they
are finalized.


is there anything else i can help you with ?

Tatiana Karam VIP  11-Mar-23, 14:07
Usually Valeo sends me the PDF as soon as it’s released and in bits as they get
released cuz some tests take longer than others

Tatiana Karam VIP  11-Mar-23, 14:07
So it’s not the same time as the results are posted on the app. That takes a few
days later

Tatiana Karam VIP  11-Mar-23, 14:08
I’ll need the unilab reports as u get them

Bot  11-Mar-23, 14:08
we will make sure to send you the pd once its released then , no worries at all
