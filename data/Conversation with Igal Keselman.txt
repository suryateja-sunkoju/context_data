Igal Keselman  29-Jun-22, 15:50
We will pay every one by himself at the hotel by credit card, is it acceptable?

Bot  29-Jun-22, 15:50
We’d like to cater to what’s convenient for customers as much as we can,
payments are taken online to ensure that all bookings are confirmed, we also
promote online payments to ensure a seamless experience whenever the tests are
conducted.

Igal Keselman  29-Jun-22, 15:53
It's a little bit problematic, because we are the group of more then 10 people,
I'm checking now exactly what is the number. It will be more convenient if we
could pay at the hotel

Bot  29-Jun-22, 15:55
We can share a payment link that can be paid for by everyone

Igal Keselman  29-Jun-22, 15:56

Bot  29-Jun-22, 15:57

please have them complete the payment as we will need it before booking

Bot  29-Jun-22, 15:57
And also please share with us the details for each person so we can forward to
the lab. May we know how many people will be tested?

Igal Keselman  29-Jun-22, 15:58
